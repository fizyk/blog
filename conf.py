#   Polish -> pl
#   Russian -> ru
#   Spanish -> es
#   Italian -> it
#   Simplified Chinese -> zh-cn
#
# If you want to use Nikola with a non-supported language you have to provide
# a module containing the necessary translations
# (p.e. look at the modules at: ./nikola/data/themes/default/messages/fr.py).
# If a specific post is not translated to a language, then the version
# in the default language will be shown instead.
