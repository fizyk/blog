sfForkedDoctrineApply Plugin just got updated. New version, 1.5.10,
fixes Portugeese translation, which in fact seems to be Brazilian
Portugeese (I suppose there are differences between Portugeese and
Brazilian Portugeese, but don't know a word in neither).

Apart from that change:

-  fix for french translation, where First name and last name's
   translations got mixed
-  fix after postValidator to preValidator change
